Event Weighting
===============
The `EventWeight` package calculates a set of weights attached to art events,
including the BNB flux (an implementation based on the MiniBooNE flux model),
GENIE interaction model systematics (using GENIE ReWeight via nutools), and
additional systematic uncertainties (e.g. cross section ratio uncertainties
due to second-class currents).

This package has been imported (with some modifications) from uboonecode, the
MicroBooNE LArSoft package.
